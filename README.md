# twitter-exercise
 This project is a simple twitter-like application, implemented in Java without a database. It was developed as part of the first module in an [intensive training program](https://polotech.americanas.io/) by [Ada](https://ada.tech/sou-aluno). The application relies on in-memory data structures to store and manage user information and tweets. It allows users to create an account, log in, post and view tweets, as well as follow other users and view their tweets in a timeline.
